#Updates servo_control to reflect new output style for edison
#using mraa library

#IMPORTANT: this code assumes that the winch servos cannot turn past all the way in;
#that is, to calibrate, simply remove the drum, rotate the drum to all the way trimmed position,
#turn the servo to angle 0, and push the drum onto the servo
#Because we may actually need the servo to be running at duty_max for this to be the case (if
#the servo is flipped), we provide a bool to set this at the beginning of this code.
