Changelog for package tf2_ros
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

0.5.12 (2015-08-05)
-------------------
* remove annoying gcc warning
  This is because the roslog macro cannot have two arguments that are
  formatting strings: we need to concatenate them first.
* break canTransform loop only for non-tiny negative time deltas
  (At least) with Python 2 ros.Time.now() is not necessarily monotonic
  and one can experience negative time deltas (usually well below 1s)
  on real hardware under full load. This check was originally introduced
  to allow for backjumps with rosbag replays, and only there it makes sense.
  So we'll add a small duration threshold to ignore backjumps due to
  non-monotonic clocks.

0.5.11 (2015-04-22)
-------------------
* do not short circuit waitForTransform timeout when running inside pytf. Fixes `#102 <https://github.com/ros/geometry_experimental/issues/102>`_
  roscpp is not initialized inside pytf which means that ros::ok is not
  valid. This was causing the timer to abort immediately.
  This breaks support for pytf with respect to early breaking out of a loop re `#26 <https://github.com/ros/geometry_experimental/issues/26>`_.
  This is conceptually broken in pytf, and is fixed in tf2_ros python implementation.
  If you want this behavior I recommend switching to the tf2 python bindings.
* inject timeout information into error string for canTransform with timeout
* Contributors: Tully Foote

0.5.10 (2015-04-21)
-------------------
* switch to use a shared lock with upgrade instead of only a unique lock. For `#91 <https://github.com/ros/geometry_experimental/issues/91>`_
* Update message_filter.h
* filters: fix unsupported old messages with frame_id starting with '/'
* Enabled tf2 documentation
* make sure the messages get processed before testing the effects. Fixes `#88 <https://github.com/ros/geometry_experimental/issues/88>`_
* allowing to use message filters with PCL types
* Contributors: Brice Rebsamen, Jackie Kay, Tully Foote, Vincent Rabaud, jmtatsch

0.5.9 (2015-03-25)

0.5.8 (2015-03-17)
------------------
* fix deadlock `#79 <https://github.com/ros/geometry_experimental/issues/79>`_

* Fix static broadcaster with rpy args
* Contributors: Paul Bovbel, Tully Foote, Vincent Rabaud

0.5.7 (2014-12-23)
------------------
* Added 6 param transform again
  Yes, using Euler angles is a bad habit. But it is much more convenient if you just need a rotation by 90° somewhere to set it up in Euler angles. So I added the option to supply only the 3 angles.
* Remove tf2_py dependency for Android
* Contributors: Achim Königs, Gary Servin
