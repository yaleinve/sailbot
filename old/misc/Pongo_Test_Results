Pongo Test Results 						Eric Anderson Mar 2015

Thoughts, in no particular order

Pongo sails are really poorly tuned- the springs are too strong (even when loosened) so the sails don't go out when going downwind/eased, the main outhaul is shit, jib v. main is never quite right.

Can't really tack easily because either not enough boatspeed for the wind or jib is just constantly too tight.  The boat didn't really get a lot of boatspeed- possibly never held bow out of wind enough and was constantly stalling the rudder.

The boat heels way over even with a little wind.  Makes me think WE NEED A REALLY DEEP KEEL ON RATCHET and a good amount of ballast.

Reverse rudder control actual feels natural- like a tiller
