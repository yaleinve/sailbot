Rigging Notes			Eric Anderson Mar 2015

American Model Masts Phone Conversation:
  Ships in a day or two
  He doesn't know anything about 
  Hesitant about holes in the mast, but unavoidable


TALK TO LARRY IN WISCONSIN/LOOK AT HIS EMAILS!!!

Booms/Clubs should have sheet run along from tack to sheeting point and then to deck.
 - this way the line running parallel to the boom can be adjusted to tune for length
 - 

Masts:
  From S/B Construction Guide, use 72" mast stepped on deck
  Ludwig Manufacturing- sent an email to "Larry" w/ Q's on 3/6
  - LOTS info in Larry's emails!!!



Sail Connection Methods:

Standing Rigging:
  Can connect using baby tangs
  Can connect by drilling hole in mast/threading with stopper knot (not recommended for S/B b/c boat is heavy, may chafe) BUT LARRY RECOMMENDS SO PROBABLY OKAY!!!!
  Spreaders: Can install as dowel straight through the mast, can have it go through the lower hole of tangs (for lowers)
  Do I want to use turnbuckles?  Is there an easier way to adjust?
  Can use plastic-coated 45lb multithreaded fishing line (buy swivel snaps, too!)


Main Boom: From S/B Construction Guide, 24" long
see Larry's emails

Hardware:
  thru deck fairleads http://pekabe.com/store2/thru-deck-fairleads/
  turn buckles at same site

Probably: gooseneck, boom, mast, club all from larry
