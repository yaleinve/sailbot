Immediate Goals:
1) Get a driver for the airmar working - JASON
 	a) most data printed to airmar topic
 	b) gps data printed to gps topic (as a temporary sol'n before gps is hooked up)i
        c) Jason to test airmar gps and see if it's okay or not
2) Get a driver for the gps working (and printing to a gps topic)
3) After 1), start testing speedStats and tactics modules.  
	a) test separately
	b) test linked
	c) test with gps driver (instead of airmar gps?)
4) Complete leg queueing in Captain and test
5) Test Navigator module
	a) with dummy input
	b) with input from (tested) captain

UPDATE SPECS- ERIC


Steps 1 and 2 can be done concurrently.
Step 3 can be started after step 1 and completed after step 2
Step 4 can be started after step r21
Step 5 comes after step 4 because it's not as time critical 


THERE'S ALWAYS MORE TO DO!  IF YOU'RE NOT FEELING RUSHED,
YOU'RE MISSING SOMETHING!
