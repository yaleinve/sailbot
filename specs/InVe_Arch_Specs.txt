InVe Sailboat Software Specifications


Node specifications
  a) captain
  b) airmar
  c) tactics
  d) sails_rudder
  e) servo_control


Definitions:

  "Compass Direction" : informally used here to mean the angle between a direction vector and magnetic north, measured CLOCKWISE in degrees (90 deg corresponds to east).

  Wind Direction: The direction that the wind is COMING FROM, measured as a compass direction.

  True Wind: the wind felt when not moving relative to the Earth

  Apparent Wind: the wind felt when moving relative to the Earth

  Course: a) The intended direction of travel of the boat, measured as a compass direction b) The area of water in which sailing will occur (i.e. the racecourse)  Course Over Ground, or COG, is the compass heading of the boat as determined from the derivative of gps coordinates

  (Absolute) Bearing: the compass direction from your current position to a specific target (From New Haven, NYC's bearing ~ 270deg)

  Heading: The compass direction the boat is pointing (note this isn't nec. the same as the direction it is moving)

  Rhumbline: A virtual line (ex: on a map) connecting a starting point to a goal location.  For our purposes, we can think of this line as a 'straight' line between the two points.  The technical definition is a line of constant bearing, (loxodrome), not a line on a great circle from point to point (orthodrome).  Gotta love spherical coordinates.

  VMG: "Velocity Made Good"- the component of velocity in the direction of the course.  ex: if you travel northeast when you want to go east, your vmg is speed*cos(45)

  XTE: "Cross Track Error": Given a rhumbline, the current (perpindicular) distance from that line.

Node Specifications

a) captain
   Subscriptions: /competition_info, /airmar_data
   Publications:  /leg_info, /autonomous_status

   Description: Determines the leg that the boat should sail.  If the previous leg is completed (also determined by capn, based on cartesian distance to end of leg + fidelity of gps), publishes the next leg

   Wait: Currently don't do anything. Could potentially choose to do something else like heave-to.
   SailToPoint mode: create a leg from current position directly to a lat, lon point.
   Maintain Heading: Create a leg 50 km from our current position using the angle passed in
                     competition info.
   MaintainPointOfSail: Create a leg 50 km from our current position, maintaining an angle to
                        the wind passed in by competition info.
   RoundAndReturn mode: use gpsTarg1 as a windward mark,gpsTarg2 as a return
      point. Create multiple legs to sail AROUND the mark (don't hit it!).  Set leg_info to the first leg.  When the first leg is complete, move on to the second leg, etc.
   StationKeeping mode: Stay within a box specified by four lat lon pairs passed in through
                        competition info.

b) airmar
   Publications:  /airmar_data

   Reads information from the airmar weather station sensor and populates/publishes the airmar_data
   topic used by various other nodes.

c) speed_calculator
   Subscriptions: /leg_info, /airmar_data
   Publications: /speed_stats

   Calculates speed metrics including VMG and XTE.

d) tactics
   Subscriptions: /leg_info, /airmar_data, /speed_stats
   Publications:  /nav_targets

   Using the information in /airmar data and /leg_info, such as wind direction, our current XTE,
   our pointing angle, etc..  this node determines which way we should tack. This information is published in the /nav_targets topic.

e) sails_rudder
   Subscriptions: /airmar_data, /nav_targets
   Publications:  /sails_rudder_pos

   Given the nav_targets information published by tactics telling the boat where we want to go, this node determines the angles we need to change the rudder, main, and jib to achieve motion
   along this target_course. It publishes the /sails_rudder_pos topic which just consists of the three angles the node calculates.

d) servo_control
   Subscriptions: /sails_rudder_pos

   Subscribes to /sails_rudder_pos topic and changes the three servos to obtain the 3 angles on the rudder, main sail, and jib as specified in the topic.
